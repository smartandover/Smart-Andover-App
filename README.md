# iOS Notes
- Use the .xcworkspace when working with the Xcode project.
- iOS 13.0 required for deployment.
- User interface constructed entirely through SwiftUI.
- If shifting database services, functionality should only be implemented in the ```DatabaseController``` class. Admins can access [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) using the Smart Andover email.
- Review Apple's Privacy Policy for every new iOS release and update project's property list as needed.
